 Saver Features Module
 
 NOTE: This won't work without the other 2 modules of the saver!
 These two modules are SaverCore & SaverInterface

SaverFeatures is the module with all the mods available at saver!
It's open source cause i want everyone to make his own mods and if they want share them with others!

 At the moment saver is at very early stages this repository is so you guys can see the updates about it!

Saver don't have any patches required for it to work with your server! The only thing changes is the interface

Here a diagram how it connects to the l2j
